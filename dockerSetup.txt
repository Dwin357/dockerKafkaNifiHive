So...  I guess I don't have docker installed.


Following this guide: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-18-04

**It is now set up so that my user is part of the docker group (so don't need to sudo everything)



"SSH" into running container
	$ docker exec -it <container name> /bin/bash

Add docker group to user (run 1x)
NOTE: this is how you can not sudo before all docker commands
	$ sudo usermod -aG docker ${USER}

Activate new group membership (run 1x per session?)
	$ su - ${USER}

Check what groups current user is part of
	$ id -nG
