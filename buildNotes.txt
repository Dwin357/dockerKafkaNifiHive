The original idea for this comes from work, where we are trying to set up a local container env which runs kafka -> nifi -> hive


This is the recipie I found: https://github.com/sciencepal/dockers/tree/master/hadoop_hive_spark_docker

	Got the local resource working (it looks like)
	- want to make some templates

2021.04.07:1935
	to get this working, 2 challenges remain
	- change files from using download/wget to using things in resource files
	- change from using [ubuntu & postgres] base images with [redhat & bitnami-pg]

	addressing the first, gameplan is to 
	- build w/ wget -> exec in -> confirm location, permissions, etc
	- TODAY I LEARNED
		-- the docker ADD command automagically un-tars zip files (but leaves jars alone)

 - everything is launhed (in theory)
 - able to visit nifi <http://localhost:8080/nifi>
 - able to exec into nifi-container (nifi.sh status)
 - able to exec into edge-node (hdfs dfs -ls /)

Remaining goals...
	x - publish kafka msg <terminal> (...I think it is on the edge node)
	x - consume kafka msg <terminal>
	x - consume kafka msg <nifi>
	<skip> - publihs kafka msg <nifi>
	x - get file info <nifi>
		+ needed to add hdfs-site & core-site to nifi-container, and it just worked!?!
	x - putHdfs / getHdfs <nifi>
		+ just works, given files above

	We are able to...
	- publish to container-kafka using terminal producer
	- read from kafka in nifi
	- put file from nifi to hdfs
	- exec into edge node and hdfs dfs -ls to see the file

Remaining goals
	- (maybe?) connect to beeline ...from the edge node?
	- connect to hive from nifi-hdfs-processor

	Resources:
		https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29113323/connecting-to-hive-using-beeline

	Question: to make beeline connection, I need to pass the connection url (but what should that be?)

	This example looks like what we use at work

	beeline -u jdbc:hive2://silver-server-hive.app.google.com:10000 -n <yourname> -p <yourpassword> --incremental=true**

	Based on reading, I believe the server is supposed to be the "hive2server"...
	...now just need to figure out which one that is


	Observation:
		This line is from the start script: docker exec -u hadoop -d nodemaster hive --service hiveserver2
		-u is user; so hadoop user
		-d is detached head
		clearly hiveserver2 is also in the mix here too

		Looking at this line from the start script
		docker exec -u hadoop -d edge /home/hadoop/kafka/bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh -daemon  /home/hadoop/kafka/config/zookeeper.properties

		-d <node> <command> <..? arguments to command>

		So then, going back to the original; nodemaster is the container, hive is the command, hiverserver2 is an arg?

		So to put it all together, I should be able to connect to hive w/ 
		beeline -u jdbc:hive2://nodemaster:10000 -n <yourname> -p <yourpassword>

		THIS WORKED, at least to log in and show tables (run on edge node)
			$ beeline -u jdbc:hive2://nodemaster:10000

		after some back and forth, was able create a table (using beeline) w/ the following

		CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE people_table ROW FORMAT SERDE 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.avro.AvroSerDe' WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ('avro.schema.literal'='{"name":"person","type":"record","fields": [{"name":"full_name", "type":"string"},{"name":"age", "type":"int", "default":999}]}') STORED AS INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.avro.AvroContainerInputFormat' OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.avro.AvroContainerOutputFormat' LOCATION '/user/dwin/people';

		Then put an element into hdfs (using nifi)
		{
			"full_name":"rolling rock",
			"age":33
		}

		When tried to query using beeline, got this error
		Error: java.io.IOException: org.apache.avro.AvroTypeException: Found long, expecting int

		Going to try and drop the table, and re-run w/ all strings --see if that works
		Yep - It works!?!


	2021.03.26:2138
		tried to setup an execute-sql processor in nifi to replicate the select that worked w/ beeline

		tried sql query - both ending w/ ";" and w/out, in either case I got the same error
			executesql.error.message
			Method not supported

		thinking - tried using a "HiveConnectionPool", maybe instead a "DBCPConnectionPool"

		to make this work - I need to have a "Database Driver Class Name"
		...
		maybe(?):org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver


Success!!!
	- had to change it up slightly...  ended up using a SelectHiveQl+HiveConnectionPool
			no driver was needed, just the connection URL
	- also, breaks if you use ";"
	- but if you do both of those --boom, totally works

Next challenge - how to make it auto load a template
